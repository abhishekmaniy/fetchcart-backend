Camera is okayish and could've be better but again you're not buying a Dslr , Keep that in Mind! Also the screen touch is buttery and looking good.

      "review": "I ordered this phone on 17 july and got it on 18 july it was good and fair for its money,using it for the first time made it heat too much but that's not an issue, after sometime it was good the camera quality was good and the video recording was fair and gaming is excellent for a well balanced phone.Many reviewers are complaining about the speakers being a single channel.Yes the speakers maybe a little poor but the sound is loud and the quality is ok and it's missing the haptics and the battery is also good enough.The another important thing is the UI that it is a combination of both one plus and iOS. The dynamic island copy on this phone is pretty good and the flexibility of Android makes this a phone best of both UI's and the AI features such as erasing background image optimising it works fine around 8 times out of 10.If anyone Is looking for alternatives of samsung in under 25k range i recommend this phone for its quality and please don't compare this to another products because it's a kind of its own\n  \nRead more",

In daylight expect the same picture quality as any Samsung's 15k device.3. If you want one reason not to buy, it is the speaker. No dual speaker, the quality of existing speaker is not good enough.
